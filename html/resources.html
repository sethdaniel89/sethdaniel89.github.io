    <p>Spark: A Burning Man Story tells the great adventure of the annual arduous, yet spiritually rewarding process of developing Burning Man. For the +60,000 attendees, this is more than just a week long desert party, it's an experience, and it's one that is full of hard work, and effort along the way. Many people think that you just show up, and that's that, for the fortunate few, maybe that's the case, but everyone else thinks, plans, creates strategies, and breaths Burning Man all year long. Spark, partnered with Burning Man Org. to bring this great documentary, which explores all the hardships into the process of planning for the event, building of the man, and any other coordinating.

    <p>Heads up! If the video does not play here, it's simply because it doesn't have access from Youtube, so you can always watch it there, which you should ;)</p>

    <p>Charlie goes to Burning Man, is the great story of one man's adventure to Burning Man for the first time ever. A man at the point in his life with nothing to lose, finds himself delving into a brand new world, in order to bring a sense of life back into his living. Charlie Warner, 81, New York City native, media professor, is stricken with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), although it is gratefully in remission. Has diabetes, had an open heart surgery, some walking troubles, and was really afraid to jump into something so different and vast. He immediately fit right in at Burning Man, and even set up shop within his camp, as the Career and Advice guru, with a sign saying "Yoda Is In". Realizing how much of a spiritual experience Burning Man encompasses, he became very vocal about how much Burning Man is the essence of life, how life should be lived, and how death should be celebrated.

    <p> Watch the video, and find out more yourself, it'll change your life.</p>

    <p>"I didn't want to not have the opportunity to come here, so I said I'm just gonna do it." - Charlie Warner</p>
